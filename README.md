# Vanilla-JavaScript-Calculator
A simple calculator using vanilla javascript

I created this calculator to start with the basics of javascript, css and html along side building wireframes and design (in adobe XD)
I tried to recreate the windows 10 calculator using these tools.

Not everything is working yet, but it is a work in progress.

I starterd building it as mobile first so the version for desktop isn't ready yet.
you can type in the numbers and other operators using the keyboard.
